      We have decided to base our project on the dining options in NUS 
      because in the one year of being NUS students it was sometimes frustrating 
      to not be able to find a well documented centralised information bank 
      to find places to eat in NUS, making it sometimes difficult to agree on 
      where to eat together as a group and even harder to find a suitable place to eat 
      when we travel to other faculties / parts of NUS that we may not be familiar with.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Another goal of this project was to give future generations of freshmen 
      a website that they could use during their freshmen orientation camps 
      or in their first few months in school as they discover places that they 
      never knew existed in NUS. Working on this project also made us realise 
      how little we knew about the dining options NUS has to offer even after 
      a year of studying here, which gives us a sufficient to believe that the 
      freshmen can benefit even more so from using this website to search for 
      places to eat with their new friends in hall, residential colleges or 
      their tutorial and lecture groups.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Eating is a necessity in life. While we study in NUS, it is sometimes 
      important to take a break and find something you would like to eat for 
      lunch or dinner without travelling too far away. We believe our project 
      can go a long way in helping students discover and find new places to 
      frequent to settle their meals, as well as for the food stall owners an 
      opportunity to let their businesses be known by the students.      
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      As we rejoice in our short and fast-paced 4-5 years in this school, 
      we would like to share the joy of food with our fellow NUS students and staff, 
      and we hope you manage to find a hidden gem or cheap thrills in this huge yet 
      beautiful campus with an extensive list of food to offer us.</div>
